# covid-rumor-stance

This is my thesis project about "stance detection on Twitter for COVID-19 misinformation", a task of determining whether a tweet is in favor or against of a given misinformation item, or neither. The dataset and code have been released. A detailed description of the dataset will be added shortly. Note that the code cannot currently be run directly.
